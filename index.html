<!--paragraph-->
	<p>My name is Frank Formaro and I'm a senior at the University of Iowa.
		I'm majoring in MIS with a minor in Computer Science.  I'm a member of BTA, and the Iowa
		Tennis Club. </p>
		
	<p>I was born in Arizona but moved to Iowa shortly after that.  After graduation I hope to get back
		to a state where it doesn't snow!  I grew up in Des Moines, I am the youngest of five children and I have
		five nephews and two nieces.  </p>
		
	<p>I really enjoy playing music with my friends.  I play guitar, some drums, and some piano.  I also 
		like to travel.  My favorite place I have been to is Italy.  I'm half Italian and meeting the parts of my
		family that live there was great! It made me want to be able to communicate with them, so now I am 
		taking Italian here at U of I. </p>
